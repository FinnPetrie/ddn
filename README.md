# Deep Declarative Networks

Deep Declarative Networks (DDNs) are a class of deep learning model that allows optimization problems
to be embedded within an end-to-end learnable network. This repository maintains code and resources for
developing and understanding DDN models.

## Running code

When running code from the commandline make sure you add the `ddn` package to your PYTHONPATH. For example:

```
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:ddn
python tests/testBasicDeclNodes.py
```

## License

The `ddn` library is distributed under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
